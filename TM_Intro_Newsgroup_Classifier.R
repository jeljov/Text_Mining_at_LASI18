## This script is created by Jelena Jovanovic (http://jelenajovanovic.net/), 
## for LASI'18 Workshop on Text mining for learning content analysis 
## (https://solaresearch.org/events/lasi/lasi-2018/lasi18-workshops/)


## The script provides an example of the overall process of text classification, 
## including: 
## - preprocessing of textual data;
## - transformation of unstructured (textual) data into a structured data format (DTM)
##   that can be fed into a classification algorithm; this includes different methods
##   for feature weighting and selection, as well as methods for reducing / transforming
##   the feature space (i.e. turning a large number of sparse features into a much
##   smaller number of dense features);
## - application of classification algorithms on the transformed textual data (that is,
##   the built feature set);
## - evaluation of the classification results.
##
## The example is based on a subset of the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

## ON THE DATASET
## 
## The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup 
## documents (forum posts), partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups,
## each corresponding to a different topic.
##
## In case the term "newsgroup" is new to you: 
## A newsgroup is an online discussion forum accessible through Usenet.
## Usenet is a decentralized computer network, like Internet, created by two university 
## students in 1979, and initially primarily used by students and staff in universities  
## across the U.S. to communicate by sharing messages, news, and updates. It is still
## in active use with over 100K newsgroups (see: https://www.binsearch.info/groupinfo.php)
##
## The dataset is publicly available from: http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/
##
## We will use the recommended, "bydate" version of the data set (20news-bydate.tar.gz),
## which consists of 18,846 documents, sorted by date into training(60%) and test(40%) sets. 
## Each subdirectory in both train and test bundles represents a newsgroup; 
## each file in a subdirectory is a message posted to that newsgroup.

# The script makes use of the following R packages:
# - caret, e1071 - for various ML tasks
# - randomForest - for building classifiers based on the Random Forest algorithm
# - quanteda - for various text analytics tasks
# - stringr - for advanced string processing
# - irlba - for singular vector decomposition (SVD)
# - dplyr, tidyr, purrr, reader - for general data analysis tasks 
# - ggplot2 - for visualization
# - doSNOW - for multi-core parallel process execution 
# If you miss any of these packages, install them, before proceeding with the script
# install.packages(c("<package_name_1>", "<package_name_2>", ...))

# Initially, we will load just a basic set of packages; 
# the others will be loaded along the way, as we need them.

# Weâ€™ll start by reading in posts from the "20news-bydate-train" and

# Each post has some extra text that we do not want to include in our analysis. 
# For example, every post has a header, containing fields such as 'from:' or 'in_reply_to:' 
# Some also have automated email signatures, which occur after a line containing just dashes 
# (e.g. '--' or '---')
# As an example, examine post 103128

## SELECT TWO NEWSGROUPS FOR A BINARY CLASSIFICATION TASK  
#########################################################

## Even though the 20 Newsgroup dataset allows for multiclass classification,
## to make this example easier to follow and understand, we will limit ourselves 
## to a binary classification task. Note that the same procedure is applicable  
## to multiclass classification, only the computation process would be more 
## demanding and thus the computation time much longer. 

# For this example, we will choose the group discussing guns ('talk.politics.guns')
# and the one on Mideast ('talk.politics.mideast'), both within the broader 'politics'  
# topic. The rationale for this selection:
# - It represents a case that we can expect in a discussion forum of a course dealing 
#   with current political issues and topics.  
# - Being topically closely related, the two groups will pose a challenge for a 
#   classifier - it is not an easy task to differentiate between groups of  
#   posts where we can expect a lot of shared vocabulary (at least far more than
#   in the case of differentiating between posts on, e.g., space and medicine).     

selected_ngs <- c('talk.politics.guns', 'talk.politics.mideast') 
selected_lbls <- c('guns', 'mideast')

train_2cl <- cleaned_train_posts %>%
  filter(newsgroup %in% selected_ngs) %>%
  mutate(newsgroup = factor(newsgroup, # transform newsgroup into a factor w/ shorter labels
                            levels = selected_ngs,
                            labels = selected_lbls))
test_2cl <- cleaned_test_posts %>%
  filter(newsgroup %in% selected_ngs) %>%
  mutate(newsgroup = factor(newsgroup, 
                            levels = selected_ngs,
                            labels = selected_lbls))

# Examine the class balance in the train and test sets 
table(train_2cl$newsgroup)
table(test_2cl$newsgroup)
# Both training and test sets are well balanced.
# If this was not the case, that is, if there was a prominent class imbalance,
# we would have to apply a subsampling technique to reduce the difference in the
# training set; these techniques are well covered in the *caret* R package:
# https://topepo.github.io/caret/subsampling-for-class-imbalances.html

# We will now use the training set to build a classifier.
# Test set will be used later, only for evaluation purposes.

# Note: for more sophisticated measures of lexical diversity, check the
# textstat_lexdiv() f. of the *quanteda* package, or the *koRpus* package
# https://reaktanz.de/?c=hacking&s=koRpus

# While the two newsgroups seem to be similar in terms of TTR (should be

# Finally, compare the two newsgroups based on the TTR

# The difference in TTR is less pronounced, though might turn to be relevant; 
# we can also check it using a statistical test:

## Note: regular expressions are very handy and often indispensable for text cleaning.
## If in need to learn about them or refresh your memory, this tutorial is excellent:

## Also, the following R cheatsheet comes in useful:

# Next, we will reduce all tokens to lower letters to reduce the variability of 
# the token set (a part of the process known as text normalization)
train_tokens <- tokens_tolower(train_tokens)
train_tokens[[9]]

# Since forum posts, as well as messages exchanged in other kinds of online  
# communication channels (e.g. chat, status posts), tend to have misspelled 
# words, it might be useful to do spelling correction, as a part of the text 
# normalization step. Typical approach is to check the text against some of 
# the available misspelling corpora 
# (e.g. http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~ROGER/corpora.html).
# There is also an R package - spelling - for spell checking:
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spelling/index.html
# We will skip this step for now.

# Next, we will remove stopwords.
# To that end, we will use quanteda's built-in stopword list for English.
?stopwords
# Note: depending on the task at hand, you might want to extend the built-in
# stopword list with additional, corpus specific 'stopwords' 
# (e.g. overly frequent words in the given corpus). Or, you might want to 
# consider a larger stopwords list (than the default one); in that case, 
# check the stopwords lists offered by the stopwords R package:
stopwords::stopwords_getsources()
# In any case, it is advised to inspect a stopword list before 
# applying it to the problem at hand.
head(stopwords(), n = 30)

# CREATE DOCUMENT TERM MATRIX (DTM)

# Considering the large number of features (~12.35K) and the high level of
# sparsity, we should consider removing rare features, that is, words with 
# very low corpus frequency.

# Examine total (corpus) TF for each word:

# BUILD the 1st ML MODEL: RPART + UNIGRAMS + TF WEIGTHS
########################################################

# As per best practices, we will leverage cross validation (CV) for our

# tune parameters and find the best performing model.

# Note that our data set is not trivial in size. As such, depending on the
# chosen ML algorithm, CV runs might take a long time to complete. 
# To cut down on total execution time, we use the *doSNOW* R package 
# to allow for cross-validation in parallel on multiple (logical) cores.

# Due to the size of the DTM, at this point, we will use a single decision
# tree (DT) algorithm to build our first model. We will use more powerful algorithms 
# later when we perform feature reduction to shrink the size of our feature set.

# Load also the *rpart* R package required for building DTs

## APPLY TF-IDF WEIGHTING SCHEME
################################

# Our first model can be characterized as being based on Bag-of-Words
# text representation, since we used only words (unigrams) and 
# estimated words' relevancy based on their frequency (TF).

# However, TF is not always the best metric for estimating the relevance of a word 
# in a corpus. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) tends to provide
# better results, and here is why:
# - The TF metric does not account for the fact that longer documents will have 
#   higher individual term counts. By normalizing TF values, using, for example, 
#   L1 norm, that is, the document length expressed as the number of words,
#   we get a metric that is length independent.
# - The IDF metric accounts for the frequency of term appearance in all documents 
#   in the corpus. The intuition being that a term that appears in almost every  
#   document has practically no predictive power.
# - The multiplication of (normalized) TF by IDF allows for weighting each term 
#   based on both its specificity at the level of the overall corpus (IDF) and its 
#   specificity for a particular document (TF).

# led to the same classifier performance, with significantly

####################################
# SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION (SVD)
# FOR REDUCING THE FEATURE SPACE
####################################

# We will now use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the number 
# of features (ngrams) to a smaller set that explains a large portion of 
# variability in the data.

# Suggested reading for SVD and Latent Semantic Analysis, the latter being, in fact,
# SVD applied to text analytics:
# - Landauer, T. K., Foltz, P. W., & Laham, D. (1998). Introduction to Latent 
#   Semantic Analysis. Discourse Processes, 25, 259-284. 
#   URL: http://lsa.colorado.edu/papers/dp1.LSAintro.pdf


# First, we need to setup the data to which SVD will be applied.  
# What we need is TF-IDF weighted TDM (Term Document Matrix). 
# Note: TDM is nothing more than transposed DTM.
# Since our DTM with bigrams included is very large, we need to 
# reduce its size, though not as much as we did above 
# (taking just top 2.5 percentile) - we need somewhat larger 
# base so that we allow more ngrams to contribute to the new 
# feature space (singular vectors)
# So, let's re-examine the distribution of TF-IDF weights
summary(tfidf_2_total)
# Considering the number of features and very low TF-IDF values,
# we'll keep tokens with TF-IDF above the 3rd quartile
to_keep <- which(tfidf_2_total > quantile(tfidf_2_total, probs = 0.75))
train_dfm_4_svd <- dfm_keep(train_dfm_2, pattern = names(to_keep), 
                            valuetype = "fixed", verbose = TRUE)
train_dfm_4_svd  

# Next, we need to set the number of the most important singular vectors we wish 
# to calculate and retain as features (in SVD terms, it is the rank (k) the original 
# matrix is to be reduced to).
# How to determine the "right" number of singular vectors is still an open issue.
# Some useful links on that topic:
# - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9582291/how-do-we-decide-the-number-of-dimensions-for-latent-semantic-analysis 
# - https://irthoughts.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/lsi-how-many-dimensions-to-keep/

# We will reduce the dimensionality down to 300 columns. This number is chosen as it
# is often recommended (based on the experience in practice).
# To get the best results, the number of dimensions would have to be experimentally 
# determined, by trying several different values and comparing the performance of 
# the resulting models.

# We'll use the *irlba* R package for SVD
library(irlba)
set.seed(seed)
svd_res <- irlba(t(as.matrix(train_dfm_4_svd)), # SVD / LSA requires TDM (not DTM) as its input
                 nv = 300, # the number of dimensions (singular vectors) to estimate
                 maxit = 600) # maxit is set to be twice larger than nv

# Examine the result:
str(svd_res)
# d - corresponds to singular values (values on the diagonal of the sigma matrix)
# u - corresponds to the left singular vector and respresents relation between
#     the extracted dimensions and the ngrams 
# v - corresponds to the right singular vector and respresents relation between
#     the extracted dimensions and the documents

# Save the SVD result to have a quick access to it later
saveRDS(svd_res$d, "models/classification/svd_d.RData")
saveRDS(svd_res$u, "models/classification/svd_u.RData")
saveRDS(svd_res$v, "models/classification/svd_v.RData")


# A glimpse into the new feature set (the right singular vector):
View(svd_res$v[1:20,1:50])

# Next, we will examine the predictive power of the model with singular 
# vectors as features

## Before proceeding to the creation of a classifier, note that there is
## an alternative approach to data preparation for SVD / LSA.
## It was suggested in the original paper on SVD / LSA by Landauer, Foltz, 
## & Laham (1998):
##    "Before the SVD is computed, it is customary in LSA to subject the data 
##    in the raw word-by-context matrix to a two-part transformation. 
##    First, the word frequency (+ 1) in each cell is converted to its log. 
##    Second, the information-theoretic measure, entropy, of each word 
##    is computed as: -p*logp over all entries in its row, 
##    and each cell entry then divided by the row entropy value. 
##    The effect of this transformation is to weight each word-type occurrence  
##    directly by an estimate of its importance in the passage and inversely 
##    with the degree to which knowing that a word occurs provides information 
##    about which passage [document] it appeared in."
##
## So, instead of TF-IDF, transform the original DTM (train_dfm_2) in the 
## manner suggested above, apply SVD on thus transformed DTM, and build 
## a RF model, as we do below. Compare the results with those of rf_cv_1 
## (given below, model 5).

# Lastly, when the best value for mtry is chosen, caret will use it to build the

# - Lower casing
# - Stopword removal
# - Stemming
# - Adding bigrams

# (features) as the training DTM.
# The rationale: once a classifier is deployed and used, we should 
# expect that new posts will contain n-grams that did not exist in 
# the training data set. In spite of this, we need to represent any 
# new post in the feature space that our classifier 'is aware of', 
# and that is the feature space of the training set.

# With the initial test DTM in place, the next step is to 'project' 
# the test features into the same TF-IDF vector space we built for our 
# training data. This requires the following steps:
# 1 - Normalize term counts (TF) in each document (i.e, each row of DTM)
# 2 - Perform IDF multiplication using training IDF values
# (Note: we use the IDF values from the training set, as we represented
# our test data using the features (ngrams) of the training set; besides,
# a large proportion of the features would have DF=0 on the test set)

# Normalize term counts in all test posts
test_tf <- dfm_weight(test_dfm, scheme = "prop")

# Next, get IDF values of the training set features, in particular,
# of features included in the train_dfm_4_svd DTM
# (Note: the inverse_doc_freq() f. is defined in the UtilityFunctions R script)

# Next, calculate TF-IDF using IDF of our training corpus

dim(test_tfidf)
# Transpose the matrix (so that the documents are in the rows)

# With the test data projected into the TF-IDF vector space of the training
# set, we can now do the final projection into the training SVD space.

## APPLYING SVD PROJECTION ON A NEW DATA SET
##############################################

# The formula to be used for this projection (of a particular document - d): 
#
# d_hat = sigma_inverse * transposed_U_matrix %*% d_TF-IDF_vector
#
# d_hat is the representation of the given document d in the SVD space of 
# the training dataset; more precisely, it is the representation of d in
# terms of the dimensions of the V matrix (right singular vector).
#
# Before applying this formula, let us examine why and how we use it

# As an example, let's use the first document from the training set, 
# that is, the TF-IDF representation of the first post in the train set
example_doc <- as.matrix(train_dfm_4_svd)[1,]

# For convenience, we'll introduce:
sigma_inverse <- 1 / svd_res$d
u_transpose <- t(svd_res$u)

# The projection of the example document in the SVD space:
example_doc_hat <- as.vector(sigma_inverse * u_transpose %*% example_doc)
# Look at the first 10 components of projected document...
example_doc_hat[1:10]
# ... and the corresponding row in the document space produced by SVD (the V matrix)
svd_res$v[1, 1:10]
# The two vectors are almost identical (note the values are expressed in e-04, e-05,...).
# In fact, the differences are so tiny that when we compute cosine similarity 
# between the two vectors, the similarity turns to be equal to 1:
library(lsa)
cosine(as.vector(example_doc_hat), as.vector(svd_res$v[1,]))
#
# Why is this useful?
# It shows that using the above given formula, we can transform any document into
# singular vector space using the computed sigma_inverse and transposed_U_matrix; 
# this further means that we can take a new, unseen document (a post in our case),
# compute TF-IDF values for it and transform it into singular vector space
# so that it can be classified by our prediction model.


# So, we will use the above given formula to represent posts from the test set in 
# the singular vector space. As we have multiple documents, we need to replace 
# d_TF-IDF_vector (3rd element on the left), with a matrix of TF-IDF values 
# (the matrix should have terms in rows and documents in columns)
test_svd_hat <- sigma_inverse * u_transpose %*% t(test_tfidf)
dim(test_svd_hat)

# With the feature set ready, we can now build the test data frame to

test_svd_df <- data.frame(Label = test_2cl$newsgroup, 
                          t(test_svd_hat)) # need to transpose it, to place documents in rows

# Now we can make predictions on the test data set using our best classifer  
# (rf_cv_1)
preds <- predict(rf_cv_1, newdata = test_svd_df)

# Examine the results
rf_1_test_eval <- confusionMatrix(data = preds, reference = test_svd_df$Label)
# (Note: the get_eval_measures() f. is defined in the UtilityFunctions.R script)
get_eval_measures(rf_1_test_eval)

# Let's compare these results with those obtained on the training data 
rf_cv_1_eval <- confusionMatrix(data = rf_cv_1$finalModel$predicted,
                                reference = train_svd_df$Label)
get_eval_measures(rf_cv_1_eval)

# All examined performance measures are notably better on the training data then 
# on the test data. This is expected, as ML models generally perform better on the 
# training than on the test set.

# Note: the fact that we got somewhat better results on CV...
comparison[5,]
# ... than when applying the final model on the whole training set; this is because
# the performance always slightly varies depending on the sample that is used for
# model building, and in CV the performance metrics are averaged over CV runs.
